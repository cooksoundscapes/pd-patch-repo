#X text 18 17 creation arguments is a list of effects to be loaded
in the grid \, from top to bottom line \; 1st inlet receives midi notes
representing grid buttons. 1st outlet outputs light data to the grid
\; 2nd inlet receives any message with a selector that matches an argument
and will update the params of the selected preset of that FX. it requires
3 values: FX - param - value \; 2nd inlet also receives save \, load
and autosave messages \; save message with only FX name saves to disk
the selected preset for that FX \; save message with FX + name saves
the selected preset on that FX \, but with the new name (does not override
existing files) \; load message needs FX + name to find the file \,
loads on the selected slot and outputs the params at 2nd outlet in
a format <channel> <FX> <param> <value> \; changing slots through midi
notes should output params on 2nd outlet as well \; with a message
'autosave 1' in 2nd outlet \, everytime a param is changed the preset
is autosaved within a second \, with the same name \; the 1st line
of the grid is reserved to switch between channels \; changing the
channel should reload all FX to the grid state \, but will not output
params by itself \, only the new light state \;, f 65;
